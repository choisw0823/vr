Frames 1-6 clearly feature a cartoon character looking at a screen (microphone and title card), whereas 7-12 switch to a different animatronic character. Temporal continuity, consistent close-ups, and visible microphone-screen pairing align with “a guy in a cartoon looks at pictures on a screen.” No other frames show a real person, and the cartoon style matches.\n\n[2] GTA V: First 3 frames are a dark-screen loading screen, then a camera looks at a dimly-lit interior (4-6) with a “CELEBRATE” sign.
